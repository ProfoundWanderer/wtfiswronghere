- What part of the error message gave a clue:
```
line 27
    elif i%num1=0:
               ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

- How I set about solving the issue (e.g.: I Googled):
  1. Went to line 27 and looked at the `=` which the error said was invalid syntax

- Summary of what was learned:
  - Going to the spot of the error is a good starting place
