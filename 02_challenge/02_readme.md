- What part of the error message gave a clue:
```
line 27, in <module>
    fizzbuzz()
TypeError: fizzbuzz() missing 1 required positional argument: 'max_num'
```

- How I set about solving the issue (e.g.: I Googled):
I went to line 27 and looked to see if it had the required number of arguments

- Summary of what was learned:
Make sure you pass the correct arguments to a function
